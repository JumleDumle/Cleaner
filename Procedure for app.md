## Usage example
An idea of how the app will be used:
- On app start: 
  1. A text field appears and the keyboard activates
  2. User inputs text
    -  Suggestions may appear based on input and earlier entries
  3. User confirms with "Confirm" button
    - Settings can allow for disabling of "Enter" to confirm input
  4. A prompt with 2 options appears: [Do you want to make another entry?]:
    - 1. "Yes"
    - 2. "View entries"
  5. On Selecting "View entries" user is taken to a calendar with only entered entries along with time stamps for entry creation
     - Perhaps support for calendar integration in the future?
