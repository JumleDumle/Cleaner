# Cleaner
A simple app for logging cleaning entries at home
It's meant to be easy and ituitive yet simplistic and fast.

This is my first time developing an app, software; Basically anything more complex than a script.
- I plan to develop the app using React Native though I have never used it before.
I still need to do a lot of research on app development and flush out the roadmap and plan feature implementation.

On top of all this I will need to refresh and deepend my knowledge on JS, HTML and CSS in order for this project to succeed.
- I expect devlopment to start around May, 2025.
