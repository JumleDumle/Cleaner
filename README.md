# Cleaner

# Postponed:
My personal situation changed drastically lately and I'm forced to postpone development of my app.
- I'll archive the repo but keep it around for future reference.

### A simple app for logging cleaning entries at home
It's meant to be an easy and simple app-solution for logging cleaning activities at home.
- I clean daily and want a simple solution to log my activity so I don't repeat the same cleaning too often.


## The plan:
This is my first time developing an app, software; Basically anything more complex than a script.
- I plan to develop the app using React Native though I have never used it before.

I still need to do a lot of research on app development and flush out the roadmap and plan feature implementation.

On top of all this I will need to refresh and deepen my knowledge on JavaScript, HTML and CSS in order for this project to succeed.
- I expect devlopment to start around 1st of May, 2025.
